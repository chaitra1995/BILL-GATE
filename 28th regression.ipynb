    "Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary \n",
    "least squares regression?\n",
    "Ridge regression is a model tuning method that is used to analyses any data that\n",
    "suffers from multicollinearity. This method performs L2 regularization. When the\n",
    "issue of multicollinearity occurs, least-squares are unbiased, and variances are\n",
    "large, this results in predicted values being far away from the actual values.\n",
    "The Ridge Regression model is most beneficial where there is multicollinearity in \n",
    "the features since its major aim is to tackle multicollinearity in the features.\n",
    "However, regardless of circumstance, the Ridge will actively seek to decrease\n",
    "overfitting compared to OLS, as evidenced by the Ridge's goal function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What are the assumptions of Ridge Regression?\n",
    "The assumptions of ridge regression are the same as that of linear regression:\n",
    "linearity, constant variance, and independence. However, as ridge regression\n",
    "does not provide confidence limits, the distribution of errors to be normal need not be assumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How do you select the value of the tuning parameter (lambda) in Ridge Regression?\n",
    "The tuning parameter lambda is chosen by cross validation. When lambda is small, the \n",
    "result is essentially the least squares estimates. As lambda increases, shrinkage\n",
    "occurs so that variables that are at zero can be thrown away.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Can Ridge Regression be used for feature selection? If yes, how?\n",
    "You could see ridge regression as doing the feature 'selection' in a nuanced way by\n",
    "reducing the size of the coefficients instead of setting them equal to zero. You could\n",
    "eliminate the features with the smaller coefficients*, but it is a bit crude method.\n",
    "Ridge regression performs better when the data consists of features which are sure to\n",
    "be more relevant and useful. mathematically,\n",
    "Lasso is = Residual Sum of Squares + λ * (Sum of the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients).\n",
    "Where, λ denotes the amount of shrinkage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. How does the Ridge Regression model perform in the presence of multicollinearity?\n",
    "Multicollinearity happens when predictor variables exhibit a correlation among themselves.\n",
    "Ridge regression aims at reducing the standard error by adding some bias in the estimates\n",
    "of the regression. The reduction of the standard error in regression estimates significantly\n",
    "increases the reliability of the estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Can Ridge Regression handle both categorical and continuous independent variables?\n",
    "Bottom line: If you have categorical data (or mixed numeric and categorical) and you are \n",
    "going to create a linear ridge regression model, you can use one-hot encoding on categorical\n",
    "variables that have three or more possible values.\n",
    "Ridge regression is used for regression purpose only as it needs the dependent variable to\n",
    "be continuous. So for your analysis Ridge regression can't be used. \n",
    "Special characteristic of Ridge regression is it works fine in presence of multicollinearity\n",
    "but with a continuous dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. How do you interpret the coefficients of Ridge Regression?\n",
    "The ridge coefficients are a reduced factor of the simple linear regression coefficients and \n",
    "thus never attain zero values but very small values. The lasso coefficients become zero in a\n",
    "certain range and are reduced by a constant factor, which explains their low magnitude in \n",
    "comparison to the ridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Can Ridge Regression be used for time-series data analysis? If yes, how?\n",
    "Yes, The ridge regression technique can be used to predict time-series. Ridge regression (RR)\n",
    "can also solve the multicollinearity problem that exists in linear regression.\n",
    "Time series regression helps predictors understand and predict the behaviour of dynamic systems \n",
    "from observations of data or experimental data. Time series data is often used for the modeling\n",
    "and forecasting of biological, financial, and economic business systems.\n",

    "Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a regularization technique used in feature selection using a Shrinkage method also\n",
    "referred to as the penalized regression method. Lasso is short for Least Absolute Shrinkage\n",
    "and Selection Operator, which is used both for regularization and model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n",
    "The main advantage of a LASSO regression model is that it has the ability to set the coefficients\n",
    "for features it does not consider interesting to zero. This means that the model does some automatic\n",
    "feature selection to decide which features should and should not be included on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?\n",
    "Lasso regression produces a model that is easy to interpret, as it includes only a subset of\n",
    "the predictors and assigns zero coefficients to the irrelevant ones. This can help in understanding \n",
    "the relationships between the predictors and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do\n",
    "they affect the model's performance?\n",
    "This property of LASSO makes it useful for feature selection, as the variables with zero coefficients\n",
    "are effectively removed from the model. Tuning parameter λ : The choice of the regularization parameter\n",
    "λ is crucial in LASSO regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?\n",
    "On the one hand, Lasso is by design a method for linear regression, and it is dubious to expect it to \n",
    "work if y depends non-linearly on Ax. On the other hand, practitioners have been successfully using\n",
    "Lasso for non-linear (especially binary) observations without theoretical backing.\n",

    "Q6. What is the difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression?\n",
    "  Ridge Regression\t                                          Lasso Regression\n",
    "1.Shrinks the coefficients toward zero\t         1.and Encourages some coefficients to be exactly zero\n",
    "2.Adds a penalty term proportional to the \n",
    "sum of squared coefficients\t                     2.Adds a penalty term proportional to the sum of absolute\n",
    "                                                   values of coefficients\n",
    "3.Does not eliminate any features\t              3.Can eliminate some features\n",
    "4.Suitable when all features are importantly\t  4.Suitable when some features are irrelevant or redundant\n",
    "5.More computationally efficient\t              5.Less computationally efficient\n",
    "6.Requires setting a hyperparameter\t              6.Requires setting a hyperparameter\n",
    "7.Performs better when there are many small\n",
    "to medium-sized coefficients\t                  7.Performs better when there are a few large coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Can Lasso Regression handle multicollinearity in the input features? If yes, how?\n",
    "Yes, With multiple linear regression, this can cause your coefficients to vary dramatically and \n",
    "throw off the interpretability of your model. Luckily, because of LASSO's built-in variable selection,\n",
    "it can handle some multicollinearity without sacrificing interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. How do you choose the optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression?\n",
    "When choosing a lambda value, the goal is to strike the right balance between simplicity and training-data\n",
    "fit: If your lambda value is too high, your model will be simple, but you run the risk of underfitting your\n",
    "data. Your model won't learn enough about the training data to make useful predictions\n",

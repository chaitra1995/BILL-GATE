    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "Elastic net regression is a type of linear regression that combines the advantages of lasso and \n",
    "ridge methods. It can handle multicollinearity, reduce overfitting, and select relevant features.-\n",
    "But it also has some drawbacks and challenges that you should be aware of.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "Larger values of alpha imply stronger regularization (less-overfitting, may be underfitting!). Smaller \n",
    "values imply weak regularization (overfitting). We want to build a model that neither overfits nor\n",
    "underfit the data. So, we need to choose an optimal value for alpha.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "Handling Multicollinearity: ElasticNet can handle multicollinearity between variables by grouping them,\n",
    "which can be very useful in certain datasets. Bias-Variance Trade-off: ElasticNet manages the bias-variance\n",
    "trade-off by balancing between Ridge and Lasso regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "Computationally Intensive: ElasticNet can be computationally expensive on large datasets due to the need \n",
    "to tune the model.\n",
    "Selection of Parameters: The selection of tuning parameters (alpha and lambda) can be tricky, as there is\n",
    "no definitive way to choose these parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are some common use cases for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "Elastic net can also be used in other applications, such as in sparse PCA, where it obtains principal\n",
    "components that are modified by sparse loadings. The other application is in the kernel elastic net, \n",
    "where the generation of class kernel machines takes place with support vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. How do you interpret the coefficients in Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "The coefficients of elastic net regression represent the linear relationship between the features and\n",
    "the target variable, adjusted by the regularization terms. The larger the absolute value of a coefficient,\n",
    "the stronger the effect of the corresponding feature on the target variable. The sign of a coefficient\n",
    "indicates the direction of the effect: positive for positive correlation, negative for negative correlation.\n",
    "The coefficients that are zero indicate that the corresponding features\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. How do you handle missing values when using Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "Missing values can be handled by deleting the rows or columns having null values. If columns have more than\n",
    "half of the rows as null then the entire column can be dropped. The rows which are having one or more columns\n",
    "values as null can also be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. How do you use Elastic Net Regression for feature selection?\n",
    "Feature selection: Elastic Net Regression can perform feature selection by shrinking the coefficients of\n",
    "irrelevant variables to zero. This results in a model with fewer variables, which is easier to interpret\n",
    "and less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. How do you pickle and unpickle a trained Elastic Net Regression model in Python?\n",
    "Using pickle , simply save your model on disc with dump() function and de-pickle it into your python code with load() function. Use open() function to create and/or read from a . pkl file and make sure you open the file in the binary format by wb for write and rb for read mode.\n",
    "To save the ML model using Pickle all we need to do is pass the model object into the dump() function of Pickle. This will serialize the object and convert it into a “byte stream” that we can save as a file called model.\n",
    "Notice that to deserialize the file, we need to use the “rb” mode which stands for read binary. Then, we unpickle the object using the load() function, after which we can store the data in a different variable and use it as we see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. What is the purpose of pickling a model in machine learning?\n",
    "The pickle module keeps track of the objects it has already serialized, so that later references to the same object won't be serialized again, thus allowing for faster execution time. Allows saving model in very little time. Good For small models with fewer parameters like the one we used\n",

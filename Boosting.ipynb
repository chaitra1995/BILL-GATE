    "There are many variations in implementation, data scientists often use boosting with decision-tree algorithms:\n",
    "Decision trees\n",
    "Decision trees are data structures in machine learning that work by dividing the dataset into smaller and\n",

    "Q4. What are the different types of boosting algorithms?\n",
    " The three main types of boosting:\n",
    "Adaptive boosting\n",
    "Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) was one of the earliest boosting models developed. It adapts and tries to \n",
    "self-correct in every iteration of the boosting process. \n",
    "AdaBoost initially gives the same weight to each dataset. Then, it automatically adjusts the weights \n",
    "of the data points after every decision tree. It gives more weight to incorrectly classified items to \n",
    "correct them for the next round. It repeats the process until the residual error, or the difference\n",
    "between actual and predicted values, falls below an acceptable threshold.\n",
    "You can use AdaBoost with many predictors, and it is typically not as sensitive as other boosting algorithms.\n",
    "This approach does not work well when there is a correlation among features or high data dimensionality. \n",
    "Overall, AdaBoost is a suitable type of boosting for classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient boosting\n",
    "Gradient Boosting (GB) is similar to AdaBoost in that it, too, is a sequential training technique. \n",
    "The difference between AdaBoost and GB is that GB does not give incorrectly classified items more weight.\n",
    "Instead, GB software optimizes the loss function by generating base learners sequentially so that the present\n",
    "base learner is always more effective than the previous one. This method attempts to generate accurate results\n",
    "initially instead of correcting errors throughout the process, like AdaBoost. For this reason, GB software can\n",
    "lead to more accurate results. Gradient Boosting can help with both classification and regression-based problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extreme gradient boosting\n",
    "Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) improves gradient boosting for computational speed and scale in several ways.\n",
    "XGBoost uses multiple cores on the CPU so that learning can occur in parallel during training. It is a boosting \n",
    "algorithm that can handle extensive datasets, making it attractive for big data applications. \n",

    "1.\twhat are the characteristics of the tuple ?is tuple immutable?\n",
    "a. Tuples are ordered,indexed collection of data.similar to string indices, the  first value in tuple  will have the index[0],the second value[1] and so on.\n",
    "b. Tuples  can store  duplicate values.\n",
    "c. once the  data is assigned the value cannot be changed .\n",
    "d. tuples allow you to store several data items  in  one variable. you can choose  to store only one kind of data in a tuple  or mix it up as needed.\n",
    "Yes it is immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\t what are the two tuple methods in python ? give an example of each method .give  a reason why tuple have only  two built in methods as compared to lists.\n",
    "               The two tuple methods are :  a. index()   b. count()\n",
    "        my_tuple=(‘a’,’p’,’p’,’l’,’e’,)\n",
    "    print(my_tuple.count(‘p’))\n",
    "    print(my_tuple.index(‘a’))\n",
    "in python tuple is immutable . you cannot change the item once is assigned .there are only  two tuple() methods index() &count()that tuple object can call.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\twhich collection datatypes in python  do not allow  duplicate  items? write  a  code  using  asset to remove  duplicates from the  given list.\n",

    "The dictionary is the unordered collection that contains key: value pairs separated by commas inside curly brackets. dictionary  are  optimized to retrieve values when the keys is known\n",
    "               Capitals={“USA”:”Washington D.C”,”France”:”paris”,”India”:”New Delhi”\n",

    "Yes. A  nested python  dictionary is a dictionary  that has  many  dictionaries . we can create a dictionary \n",
    "With that contain a number of dictionaries. With that ,we can also nest the number of dictionaries already existing as dictionaries. Let us first create  a python dictionary and fetch all the values. Here we have included 4 key-value pairs in the dictionary and displayed them. Product, model, units, and available are keys of the dictionary. Except the units key ,all  are having string values-\n",

    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. \n",
    "In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a non-relational document database that provides support for JSON-like storage. \n",
    "The MongoDB database has a flexible data model that enables you to store unstructured data,\n",
    "and it provides full indexing support, and replication with rich and intuitive APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain non-relational databases in short\n",
    "A non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and\n",
    "columns found in most traditional database systems. Instead, non-relational databases use a \n",
    "storage model that is optimized for the specific requirements of the type of data being stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "Why MongoDB is better than SQL? In comparison to the SQL server, MongoDB is faster and more scalable.\n",
    "While the SQL server supports JOIN and Global transactions, MongoDB does not.\n",
    "The MS SQL server does not accommodate large amounts of data, however MongoDB does.\n",

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "These are some important features of MongoDB:\n",
    "1. Support ad hoc queries\n",
    "In MongoDB, you can search by field, range query and it also supports regular expression searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Indexing\n",
    "You can index any field in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Replication\n",
    "MongoDB supports Master Slave replication.\n",
    "A master can perform Reads and Writes and a Slave copies data from the master and can only be used\n",
    "for reads or back up (not writes)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Duplication of data\n",
    "MongoDB can run over multiple servers. The data is duplicated to keep the system up and also keep its \n",
    "running condition in case of hardware failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Load balancing\n",
    "It has an automatic load balancing configuration because of data placed in shards.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Supports map reduce and aggregation tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Uses JavaScript instead of Procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. It is a schema-less database written in C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Provides high performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Stores files of any size easily without complicating your stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Easy to administer in the case of failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. It also supports:\n",
    "JSON data model with dynamic schemas\n",
    "Auto-sharding for horizontal scalability\n",
    "Built in replication for high availability\n",
    "\n",
    "Now a day many companies using MongoDB to create new types of applications, improve performance and availability.\n"

    "Multithreading is defined as the ability of the processor to execute multiple threads concurrently. \n",

    "This is termed as context switching. In context switching,the state of thread  is saved and state  of another\n",
    "thread is  loaded  whenever any  interrupt(due  to I/O or manually set) takes place. context switching  takes place.\n",
    "Context switching  takes places so frequently that all  the threads  appear to be running parallelly\n",
    "(this is  termed as multitasking).It is very useful technique for time saving and improving  the performance \n",

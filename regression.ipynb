    "Q1. What are the key steps involved in building an end-to-end web application,\n",
    "from development to deployment on the cloud?\n",
    "\n",
    "The development process can look different for every website, but for the most part,\n",
    "it will entail the following 8 steps:\n",
    "Step 1: Information gathering. ...\n",
    "Step 2: Planning. ...\n",
    "Step 3: Design. ...\n",
    "Step 4: Content. ...\n",

    "Q2. Explain the difference between traditional web hosting and cloud hosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right hosting is essential for the site’s speed & security. One of the most common \n",
    "dilemmas that business owners face is whether they should switch their website from tried-and-true\n",
    "traditional hosting to sleek and modern cloud hosting. There isn’t an obvious answer to this question\n",
    "because there are so many things to take into account. It would be safe to say that the choice between\n",
    "cloud web hosting and traditional web hosting will depend on your specific needs and goals.\n",
    "So, what’s the difference between cloud web hosting and traditional web hosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tInfrastructure: Cloud hosting uses a network of servers in different locations to host websites, \n",
    "while traditional hosting uses a single server or a group of servers located in a single location.\n",
    "This has implications on the performance and reliability of the hosting solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tScalability: Cloud hosting allows you to easily scale up or down the resources of your website.\n",
    "Traditional hosting typically requires you to purchase a fixed amount of resources, which may not\n",
    "be sufficient if your website experiences sudden spikes in traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tCost: While traditional hosting typically requires you to pay a fixed monthly or annual fee,\n",
    "regardless of your resource usage, the opposite is true for cloud hosting.\n",
    "When you opt for cloud-based servers, you don’t need to commit to specific resource bandwidths upfront.\n",
    "Instead, you can scale up or down as per the changing needs of your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tMaintenance: Cloud hosting providers typically handle the maintenance and updates of the hosting\n",
    "infrastructure, while traditional hosting requires you to manage these tasks yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How do you choose the right cloud provider for your application deployment,\n",
    "and what factors should you consider?\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to selecting a cloud provider, the requirements you have and evaluation\n",
    "criteria you use will be unique to your organisation.\n",
    "However, there are some common areas of focus during any service provider assessment.\n",
    "We have grouped these into 8 sections to help you effectively compare suppliers and \n",
    "select a provider that delivers the value and benefits your organisation expects from the cloud.\n",

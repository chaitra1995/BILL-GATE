    "Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "API is the abbreviation of the term Application Programming Interface. \n",
    "It is the software responsible for the connection for the communication and information \n",
    "exchange between two apps. API connects two devices or programs in order to facilitate the\n",
    "exchange of information between them. It is the interface that serves the other parts of the software.\n",
    "The API specifications are the standards or documents designed to describe the creation of such connections.\n",
    "If a computer system meets these standards, then it is said to expose an API. \n",
    "The specification or implementation both are known as the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common example of API is searching for information on the internet using an app.\n",
    "If you use an application for a particular purpose, you use the internet.\n",
    "A connection is established between the internet and the application. \n",
    "The internet provides data to the server; it retrieves data, processes the information,\n",
    "and sends it back to the phone. The task of the application is to interpret data and present\n",
    "it to the user in a readable format. This process is facilitated using API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept can be explained better with the help of an example. When you go to a restaurant \n",
    "and order food, the food comes from the kitchen. Hence the kitchen is the system.\n",
    "Your table is the place where the response is delivered. However, to deliver food on the table,\n",
    "there must be a channel of communication between the table and the kitchen.\n",
    "The waiter or API acts as a messenger between the table and the kitchen.\n",
    "It takes requests from you and tells the kitchen, which is a system, what has to be done.\n",
    "Then, the waiter delivers the response to the user, which is food in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another real-life example of API is online flights booking. \n",
    "Similar to the previous example of a restaurant, there are many options of cities,\n",
    "return and departure dates, and cabin class. \n",
    "While booking a flight ticket, you select variables including the cabin class, departure city and date,\n",
    "and return city and date. All the options and data of the flights and the cost of the ticket are displayed\n",
    "on the airline website where you book the ticket. Therefore, you need to interact with the airline databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, suppose you use another travel service website that collects the data from various databases and \n",
    "presents it to the user. In that case, the travel service acts as the API of the airline.\n",
    "Like a waiter in the restaurant, the online travel service will provide options and aid in booking tickets.\n",
    "It does so by collecting the information from the databases.\n",
    "The API will collect the airline's response to your request, deliver it to an online travel service, and \n",
    "present it to you. In this way, you will be able to fetch the most updated information regarding your\n",
    "booking and flight. The data provided by API will be most relevant and helpful for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the purpose served by the waiter in a restaurant is the same as that of the online\n",
    "travel service, and both of them are API. Hence, API is crucial for the communication between two systems.\n"

    "Advantages and Disadvantages of API :\n",
    "The future of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) looks promising, \n",
    "as recent advancements indicate API solutions hold great value in the future of healthcare.\n",
    "For API to continue to take hold of the healthcare industry advancements will continue to be made. \n",
    "Review some of the current API advantages and disadvantages :\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "1.\tIncreased Interoperability: API solutions enable different software systems to communicate with each other,\n",
    "regardless of their programming language or platform. This enhances the interoperability between systems,\n",
    "allowing for the exchange of data and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tImproved Efficiency: API driven infrastructures enable developers to reuse code and functionality from \n",
    "existing software systems, saving time and reducing the amount of code that needs to be written from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tBetter User Experience: APIs can enable third-party developers to create applications that integrate with \n",
    "existing software systems, providing a better user experience and increased functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tIncreased Flexibility: APIs provide developers with greater flexibility, enabling them to choose the best\n",

    "\n",
    "5.\tNew Revenue Streams: APIs can enable companies to create new revenue streams by providing third-party \n",
    "developers with access to their software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "1.\tSecurity Concerns: API infrastructures can be vulnerable to security breaches, such as SQL injection\n",
    "attacks and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, making it crucial to implement security measures to protect\n",
    "against these threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tComplexity: APIs can be complex, requiring a significant amount of development effort to implement and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tCompatibility Issues: APIs can have compatibility issues between different versions of the same\n",
    "software system or between different systems, which can lead to errors and system failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tDependency on Third-Party Developers: APIs rely on third-party developers to create applications\n",
    "that integrate with the software system. This can create dependencies that are outside of the control \n",
    "of the company that owns the software system.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\tGovernance and Management: APIs require proper governance and management to ensure they are being used \n",
    "correctly and consistently across different applications and systems.\n",
